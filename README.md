# Next.js Discord Bot

Source code of the Discord bot of the Next.js server (https://nextjs.org/discord).

## Running locally

To run the bot locally, copy the `.env.example` file with the `.env` name:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

And edit the contents of the file as needed. The only required variable is the bot token.

> You can get the token in the bot settings inside the Discord Developer Portal
